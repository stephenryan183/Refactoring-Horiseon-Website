# Refactoring-Horiseon-Website
This is a website whose source code is being refactored as well as organized that follow a semantic structure, to eventually meet a minimum accesible standard.

To meet the accesible standard you will see the following in the source code

* Comments highlighted in green text identifying what has been altered to meet a more accesible standard

* The comments could be found inside both the index.html as well the style.css

* An organized pattern that is consistient with the code that can be altered at any point without being a difficult to upload back to a public domain
